abstract = {1.Widespread degradation of tropical forests is caused by a variety of disturbances that interact in ways that are not well understood. 2.To explore potential synergies between edge effects, fire and windstorm damage as causes of Amazonian forest degradation, we quantified vegetation responses to a 30-minute high-intensity windstorm that in 2012, swept through a large-scale fire experiment that borders an agricultural field. Our pre- and post-windstorm measurements include tree mortality rates and modes of death, aboveground biomass, and airborne LiDAR-based estimates of tree heights and canopy disturbance (i.e., number and size of gaps). The experimental area in the southeastern Amazonia includes three 50-ha plots established in 2004 that were unburned (Control), burned annually (B1yr), or burned at three-year intervals (B3yr). 3.The windstorm caused greater damage to trees ({\textgreater}10 cm DBH) in the burned plots (B1yr: 13 ± 9{\%} of 785 trees; B3yr: 17 ± 13{\%} of 433) than in the Control plot (8 ± 4{\%} of 2300; ± CI). It substantially reduced vegetation height by 14{\%} in B1yr, 20{\%} in B3yr and 12{\%} in the Control plots, while it reduced aboveground biomass by 18{\%} of 77.7 Mg ha−1 (B1yr), 31{\%} of 56.6 (B3yr) and 15{\%} of 120 (Control). Tree damage was greatest near the agricultural field edge in all three plots, especially among large trees and in B3yr. Trunk snapping (70{\%}) and uprooting (20{\%}) were the most common modes of tree damage and mortality, with the height of trunk failure on the burned plots often corresponding with the height of historical fire scars. Of the windstorm-damaged trees, 80{\%} (B1yr), 90{\%} (B3yr), and 57{\%} (Control) were dead four years later. Trees that had crown damage experienced the least mortality (22–60{\%}), followed by those that were snapped (55–94{\%}) and uprooted (88–94{\%}). 4.Synthesis. We demonstrate the synergistic effects of three kinds of disturbance on a tropical forest. Our results show that the effects of windstorms are exacerbated by prior degradation by fire and fragmentation. We highlight that understory fires can produce long-lasting effects on tropical forests not only by directly killing trees but also by increasing tree vulnerability to wind damage due to fire-scars and a more-open canopy.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors. Fire plays an intrinsic role in shaping the biophysical attributes of savanna ecosystems. Savanna fires limit vegetation biomass below their climatically determined potential, but the magnitude of this effect and how it varies across heterogeneous landscapes are poorly understood. In this study, we explore woody tree structure and canopy characteristics across a fire manipulation experiment that has been maintained for 63 yr in South Africa's Kruger National Park. Our study design assessed three late dry-season fire regimes (biennial, triennial, and unburnt) across a precipitation gradient (737–496 mm/yr) spanning four different landscapes with a mixture of sandy and clay soils. We used terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) to quantify tree height, canopy cover, and aboveground carbon storage across the experimental treatments. Vegetation physiognomy was influenced by the interaction between landscape and fire frequency. In the absence of fire, woody height, cover, and biomass increased with increasing rainfall. The presence of fire acted to reduce structure and biomass as expected, but the magnitude of this effect increased with increasing rainfall. We found minimal difference between the effects of biennial or triennial burning—except at the wettest site where the triennial fire plots had half the biomass of those burnt biennially. The rainfall dependent fire–vegetation relationships shown here provide empirical quantification of top-down constraint by fire and highlight the challenges of predicting responses to disturbances in these inherently heterogeneous ecosystems. Robust quantification of 3D structure and dynamics through TLS will be useful for constraining carbon stock models and predicting trajectories of change under future climate and land-use conditions.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Inc. Understanding the role that the vast north Australian savannas play in the continental carbon cycle requires reliable quantification of their carbon stock at landscape and regional scales. LiDAR remote sensing has proven efficient and accurate for the fine-scale estimation of above-ground tree biomass (AGB) and carbon stocks in many ecosystems, but tropical savanna remain under studied. We utilized a two-phase LiDAR analysis procedure which integrates both individual tree detection (ITC) and area-based approaches (ABA) to better understand how the uncertainty of biomass estimation varies with scale. We used estimations from individual tree LiDAR measurements as training/reference data, and then applied these data to develop allometric equations related to LIDAR metrics. We found that LiDAR individual tree heights were strongly correlated with field-estimated AGB (R2 = 0.754, RMSE = 90 kg), and that 63{\%} of individual trees crowns (ITC) could be accurately delineated with a canopy maxima approach. Area-based biomass estimation (ABA), which incorporated errors from the ITC steps, identified the quadratic mean of canopy height (QMCH) as the best single independent variable for different plot sample sizes (e.g. for 4 ha plots: R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 3.4 Mg ha− 1; and 1 ha plots: R2 = 0.83, RMSE = 4.0 Mg ha− 1). Our results show how ITC and ABA approached can be integrated to understand how biomass uncertainty varies with scale across broad landscapes. Understanding these scaling relationships is critical for operationalizing regional savanna inventories, monitoring and mapping.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors. The reliability of airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) for delineating individual trees and estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) has been proven in a diverse range of ecosystems, but can be difficult and costly to commission. Point clouds derived from structure from motion (SfM) matching techniques obtained from unmanned aerial systems (UAS) could be a feasible low-cost alternative to airborne LiDAR scanning for canopy parameter retrieval. This study assesses the extent to which SfM three-dimensional (3D) point clouds-obtained from a light-weight mini-UAS quadcopter with an inexpensive consumer action GoPro camera-can efficiently and effectively detect individual trees, measure tree heights, and provide AGB estimates in Australian tropical savannas. Two well-established canopy maxima and watershed segmentation tree detection algorithms were tested on canopy height models (CHM) derived from SfM imagery. The influence of CHM spatial resolution on tree detection accuracy was analysed, and the results were validated against existing high-resolution airborne LiDAR data. We found that the canopy maxima and watershed segmentation routines produced similar tree detection rates ({\~{}}70{\%}) for dominant and co-dominant trees, but yielded low detection rates ( {\textless} 35{\%}) for suppressed and small trees due to poor representativeness in point clouds and overstory occlusion. Although airborne LiDAR provides higher tree detection rates and more accurate estimates of tree heights, we found SfM image matching to be an adequate low-cost alternative for the detection of dominant and co-dominant tree stands.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Cobb et al. Broad-scale forest die-off associated with drought and heat has now been reported from every forested continent, posing a global-scale challenge to forest management. Climate-driven die-off is frequently compounded with other drivers of tree mortality, such as altered land use, wildfire, and invasive species, making forest management increasingly complex. Facing similar challenges, rangeland managers have widely adopted the approach of developing conceptual models that identify key ecosystem states and major types of transitions between those states, known as "state-and-transition models" (S{\&}T models). Using expert opinion and available research, the development of such conceptual S{\&}T models has proven useful in anticipating ecosystem changes and identifying management actions to undertake or to avoid. In cases where detailed data are available, S{\&}T models can be developed into probabilistic predictions, but even where data are insufficient to predict transition probabilities, conceptual S{\&}T models can provide valuable insights for managing a given ecosystem and for comparing and contrasting different ecosystem dynamics. We assembled a synthesis of 14 forest die-off case studies from around the globe, each with sufficient information to infer impacts on forest dynamics and to inform management options following a forest die-off event. For each, we developed a conceptual S{\&}T model to identify alternative ecosystem states, pathways of ecosystem change, and points where management interventions have been, or may be, successful in arresting or reversing undesirable changes. We found that our diverse set of mortality case studies fit into three broad classes of ecosystem trajectories: (1) single-state transition shifts, (2) ecological cascading responses and feedbacks, and (3) complex dynamics where multiple interactions, mortality drivers, and impacts create a range of possible state transition responses. We integrate monitoring and management goals in a framework aimed to facilitate development of conceptual S{\&}T models for other forest die-off events. Our results highlight that although forest die-off events across the globe encompass many different underlying drivers and pathways of ecosystem change, there are commonalities in opportunities for successful management intervention.},

Journal of Applied Ecology {\textcopyright} 2017 British Ecological Society Forest dieback caused by drought-induced tree mortality has been observed world-wide. Forecasting which trees in which locations are vulnerable to drought-induced mortality is important to predict the consequences of drought on forest structure, biodiversity and ecosystem function. In this paper, our central aim was to compile a synthesis of tree traits and associated abiotic variables that can be used to predict drought-induced mortality. We reviewed the literature that specifically links drought mortality to functional traits and site conditions (i.e. edaphic variables and biotic conditions), targeting studies that show clear use of tree traits in drought analysis. We separated the review into five climatic zones to determine global vs. regionally restricted relationships between traits and mortality. Our synthesis identifies a number of traits that have clear relationships with drought-induced mortality (e.g. wood density at the species level and tree size and growth at the individual level). However, the lack of direct relationships between most traits and drought-induced mortality highlights areas where future research should focus to broaden our understanding. Synthesis and applications. Our synthesis highlights established relationships between traits and drought-induced mortality, presents knowledge gaps for future research focus and suggests monitoring and research avenues for improving our understanding of drought-induced mortality.

Lasius flavus activity has been shown to change the amounts of plant nutrients in their mound soil substrate. It is unknown how the maturity of such mounds influences nutrient status and affects plant growth. We quantified bulk soil and extractable nutrient contents of three mound development stages (young, middle-aged and fully-developed) in comparison to the surrounding soil (control), and in a bioassay using species of three plant functional types (grass, non nitrogen (N)-fixing forb, N-fixing forb) linked these to plant growth and chemistry. Our results showed that development stage was an important predictor of a mound's nutritional status. Lasius flavus activity results in decreases in bulk soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, sulfur, extractable manganese and zinc, and increases in bulk soil clay, pH, base cations, iron, phosphorous, boron, extractable calcium and potassium. The relative amounts of accumulated biomass, the proportion allocated to shoots or roots, and the N content of these tissues all differed among plant species. The N-fixing forb gained the highest total biomass and had the greatest allocation to shoots on soils of fully-developed mounds. The grass responded to all mound development stages with increased root biomass, whereas no effect was detected for the non N-fixing forb. The root N contents of the grass and the non N-fixing forb decreased with mound development stage. The findings highlight the importance of established L. flavus mounds as discrete micro-habitats in grassland ecosystems adding to biogeochemical heterogeneity.},

Drought- and heat-driven tree mortality, along with associated insect outbreaks, have been observed globally in recent decades and are expected to increase in future climates. Despite its potential to profoundly alter ecosystem carbon and water cycles, how tree mortality scales up to ecosystem functions and fluxes is uncertain. We describe a framework for this scaling where the effects of mortality are a function of the mortality attributes, such as spatial clustering and functional role of the trees killed, and ecosystem properties, such as productivity and diversity. We draw upon remote-sensing data and ecosystem flux data to illustrate this framework and place climate-driven tree mortality in the context of other major disturbances. We find that emerging evidence suggests that climate-driven tree mortality impacts may be relatively small and recovery times are remarkably fast ({\~{}}4 years for net ecosystem production). We review the key processes in ecosystem models necessary to simulate the effects of mortality on ecosystem fluxes and highlight key research gaps in modeling. Overall, our results highlight the key axes of variation needed for better monitoring and modeling of the impacts of tree mortality and provide a foundation for including climate-driven tree mortality in a disturbance framework.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd Modification of natural ecosystems has threatened biodiversity worldwide, with forests suffering especially. Strategies aimed at mitigating such loss in forests often include enrichment of deadwood, a critical resource for many decomposer species. However, it remains unclear how deadwood can best be enriched to most effectively promote the diversity of saproxylic species. In this study, we investigated saproxylic beetle diversity in experimentally exposed deadwood logs of 13 different tree species across 30 forests in three regions of Germany. We tested whether gamma-diversity differs between tree species and whether the alpha-diversity within an individual log depended on whether logs were placed in unmanaged beech forests, managed beech forests, or managed conifer forests. We found significant differences in gamma- and alpha-diversity of saproxylic beetles among tree species, but the ranking of tree species differed between regions, suggesting differences in regional beetle species pools. Randomization tests aiming to identify how many and which deadwood logs would need to be exposed to best conserve saproxylic beetle diversity, showed that the overall diversity of beetles increased with the number of tree species exposed, due to turnover of beetle species between tree species. However, some species (e.g. Carpinus) and species combinations (e.g. Carpinus-Picea) reached exceptionally high beetle diversity. Alpha-diversity was higher in conifer than in beech forests, but did not differ between managed and unmanaged beech forests. Canopy cover above logs and average stand temperature strongly influenced alpha-diversity, suggesting that environmental conditions that may be affected by management act as habitat filters for species assemblages. We conclude that deadwood enrichment strategies would be most effective when combining particular tree species that support highest diversity.},

African savannas are highly seasonal with a diverse array of both mammalian and invertebrate herbivores, yet herbivory studies have focused almost exclusively on mammals. We conducted a 2-yr exclosure experiment in South Africa's Kruger National Park to measure the relative impact of these two groups of herbivores on grass removal at both highly productive patches (termite mounds) and in the less productive savanna matrix. Invertebrate and mammalian herbivory was greater on termite mounds, but the relative importance of each group changed over time. Mammalian offtake was higher than invertebrates in the dry season, but can be eclipsed by invertebrates during the wet season when this group is more active. Our results demonstrate that invertebrates play a substantial role in savanna herbivory and should not be disregarded in attempts to understand the impacts of herbivory on ecosystems.},

Savannas cover at least 13{\%} of the global terrestrial surface and are often nutrient limited, especially by nitrogen. To gain a better understanding of their microbial diversity and the microbial nitrogen cycling in savanna soils, soil samples were collected along a granitic and a basaltic catena in Kruger National Park (South Africa) to characterize their bacterial and archaeal composition and the genetic potential for nitrification. Although the basaltic soils were on average 5 times more nutrient rich than the granitic soils, all investigated savanna soil samples showed typically low nutrient availabilities, i.e., up to 38 times lower soil N or C contents than temperate grasslands. Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing revealed a unique soil bacterial community dominated by Actinobacteria (20-66{\%}), Chloroflexi (9-29{\%}), and Firmicutes (7-42{\%}) and an increase in the relative abundance of Actinobacteria with increasing soil nutrient content. The archaeal community reached up to 14{\%} of the total soil microbial community and was dominated by the thaumarchaeal Soil Crenarchaeotic Group (43-99.8{\%}), with a high fraction of sequences related to the ammonia-oxidizing genus Nitrosopshaera sp. Quantitative PCR targeting amoA genes encoding the alpha subunit of ammonia monooxygenase also revealed a high genetic potential for ammonia oxidation dominated by archaea ({\~{}}5 × 107 archaeal amoA gene copies g-1 soil vs. mostly {\textless} 7 × 104 bacterial amoA gene copies g-1 soil). Abundances of archaeal 16S rRNA and amoA genes were positively correlated with soil nitrate, N and C contents. Nitrospira sp. was detected as the most abundant group of nitrite oxidizing bacteria. The specific geochemical conditions and particle transport dynamics at the granitic catena were found to affect soil microbial communities through clay and nutrient relocation along the hill slope, causing a shift to different, less diverse bacterial and archaeal communities at the footslope. Overall, our results suggest a strong effect of the savanna soils' nutrient scarcity on all microbial communities, resulting in a distinct community structure that differs markedly from nutrient-rich, temperate grasslands, along with a high relevance of archaeal ammonia oxidation in savanna soils.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Nordic Society Oikos. Herbivores do not forage uniformly across landscapes, but select for patches of higher nutrition and lower predation risk. Macrotermes mounds contain higher concentrations of soil nutrients and support grasses of higher nutritional value than the surrounding savanna matrix, attracting mammalian grazers that preferentially forage on termite mound vegetation. However, little is known about the spatial extent of such termite influence on grazing patterns and how it might differ in time and space. We measured grazing intensity in three African savanna types differing in rainfall and foliar nutrients and predicted that the functional importance of mounds for grazing herbivores would increase as the difference in foliar nutrient levels between mound and savanna matrix grasses increases and the mounds become more attractive. We expected this to occur in nutrient-poor areas and during the dry season when savanna matrix grass nutrient levels are lower. Tuft use and grass N and P content were measured along transects away from termite mounds, enabling calculation of the spatial extent of termite influence on mammalian grazing. Using termite mound densities estimated from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR), we further upscaled field-based results to determine the percentage of the landscape influenced by termite activity. Grasses in close proximity to termite mounds were preferentially grazed at all sites and in both seasons, but the strength of mound influence varied between savanna types and seasons. In the wet season, mounds had a relatively larger effect on grazers at the landscape scale in the nutrient-poor, wetter savanna, whereas in the dry season the pattern was reversed with more of the landscape influenced at the nutrient-rich, driest site. Our results reveal that termite mounds enhance the value of savanna landscapes for herbivores, but that their functional importance varies across savanna types and seasons.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Nordic Society Oikos. Natural protected areas are critically important in the effort to prevent large-scale megafaunal extinctions caused by hunting and habitat degradation. Yet such protection can lead to rapid increases in megafauna populations. Understanding ecosystem-scale responses of vegetation to changing megafaunal populations, such as the case of the African elephant Loxodonta africana in savannas, requires large-scale, high-resolution monitoring over time. From 2008 to 2014, we repeatedly surveyed the fate of more than 10.4 million woody plant canopies throughout the Kruger National Park, South Africa using airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), to determine the relative importance of multiple environmental, biotic and management factors affecting treefall rates and patterns. We report a mean biennial treefall rate of 8 trees or 12{\%} ha-1, but with heterogeneous patterns of loss in both space and time. Throughout Kruger, the influence of elephant density on treefall was matched only by spatial variation in soils and elevation, and all three factors co-dominated park-wide treefall patterns. Elephant density was up to two times more influential than fire frequency in determining treefall rates, and this pattern was most pronounced for taller trees ({\textgreater} 2 m in height). Our results suggest that confining megafauna populations to protected areas, or reintroducing them into former or new habitat, can greatly alter the structure and functioning of the host ecosystem. Conservation strategies will need to accommodate and manage these massive ecological changes in the effort to save megafauna from extinction, without compromising system functionality.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s). Background: Monitoring and managing carbon stocks in forested ecosystems requires accurate and repeatable quantification of the spatial distribution of wood volume at landscape to regional scales. Grid-based forest inventory networks have provided valuable records of forest structure and dynamics at individual plot scales, but in isolation they may not represent the carbon dynamics of heterogeneous landscapes encompassing diverse land-management strategies and site conditions. Airborne LiDAR has greatly enhanced forest structural characterisation and, in conjunction with field-based inventories, it provides avenues for monitoring carbon over broader spatial scales. Here we aim to enhance the integration of airborne LiDAR surveying with field-based inventories by exploring the effect of inventory plot size and number on the relationship between field-estimated and LiDAR-predicted wood volume in deciduous broad-leafed forest in central Germany. Results: Estimation of wood volume from airborne LiDAR was most robust (R2= 0.92, RMSE = 50.57 m3ha-1{\~{}}14.13 Mg C ha-1) when trained and tested with 1 ha experimental plot data (n = 50). Predictions based on a more extensive (n = 1100) plot network with considerably smaller (0.05 ha) plots were inferior (R2= 0.68, RMSE = 101.01 {\~{}}28.09 Mg C ha-1). Differences between the 1 and 0.05 ha volume models from LiDAR were negligible however at the scale of individual land-management units. Sample size permutation tests showed that increasing the number of inventory plots above 350 for the 0.05 ha plots returned no improvement in R2and RMSE variability of the LiDAR-predicted wood volume model. Conclusions: Our results from this study confirm the utility of LiDAR for estimating wood volume in deciduous broad-leafed forest, but highlight the challenges associated with field plot size and number in establishing robust relationships between airborne LiDAR and field derived wood volume. We are moving into a forest management era where field-inventory and airborne LiDAR are inextricably linked, and we encourage field inventory campaigns to strive for increased plot size and give greater attention to precise stem geolocation for better integration with remote sensing strategies.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Inc. Woody vegetation cover affects several ecosystem processes including carbon and water cycling, energy fluxes, and fire regimes. In order to understand the dynamics of savanna ecosystems, information on the spatial distribution of woody vegetation over large areas is needed. In this study we sought to assess multi-temporal ALOS PALSAR L-band backscatter to map woody cover in southern African savannas. The SAR data were acquired from the JAXA archive, covering various modes and seasons between 2007 and 2010. We used high resolution airborne LiDAR data as reference data to interpret SAR parameters (including backscatter intensities and polarimetric decomposition components), to develop SAR-based models as well as to validate SAR-based woody cover maps. The LiDAR survey was carried out in April 2008 with the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO, http://cao.ciw.edu). The highest correlations to the reference data were obtained from SAR backscatters of the dry season, followed by the wet season, and the end of the wet season. The volume components from polarimetric decompositions (Freeman-Durden, Van Zyl) were calculated for the end of wet season, and showed similar correlations to the LiDAR data, when compared to cross-polarized backscatters (HV). We observed increased correlation between the SAR and LiDAR datasets with an increase in the spatial scale at which datasets were integrated, with an optimum value at 50m. We modeled woody cover using three scenarios: (1) a single date scenario (i.e., woody cover map based on a single SAR image), (2) a multi-seasonal scenario (i.e., woody cover map based on SAR images from the same year and different seasons, based on key phonological difference), and (3) a multi-annual scenario (i.e., woody cover map based on SAR data from different years). Predicted SAR-based woody cover map based on Fine Beam Dual Polarization dry season SAR backscatters of all years yielded the best performance with an R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} of 0.71 and RMSE of 7.88{\%}. However, single dry season SAR backscatter achieved only a slightly lower accuracy (R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}=0.66, RMSE=8.45{\%}) as multi-annual SAR data, suggesting that a single SAR scene from the dry season can also be used for woody cover mapping. Moreover, we investigated the impact of the number of samples on the model prediction performance and showed the benefits of a larger spatially explicit LiDAR dataset compared to much smaller number of samples as they can be collected in the field. Collectively, our results demonstrate that L-band backscatter shows promising sensitivity for the purposes of mapping woody cover in southern African savannas, particularly during the dry season leaf-off conditions.},

Abstract: The spread of an alien invasive grass (gamba grass-Andropogon gayanus) in the tropical savannas of Northern Australia is a major threat to habitat quality and biodiversity in the region, primarily through its influence on fire intensity. Effective control and eradication of this invader requires better insight into its spatial distribution and rate of spread to inform management actions. We used full-waveform airborne LiDAR to map areas of known A. gayanus invasion in the Batchelor region of the Northern Territory, Australia. Our stratified sampling campaign included wooded savanna areas with differing degrees of A. gayanus invasion and adjacent areas of native grass and woody tree mixtures. We used height and spatial contiguity based metrics to classify returns from A. gayanus and developed spatial representations of A. gayanus occurrence (1 m resolution) and canopy cover (10 m resolution). The cover classification proved robust against two independent field-based investigations at 500 m2 (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 12.53) and 100 m2 (R2 = 0.79, RMSE = 14.13) scale. Our mapping results provide a solid benchmark for evaluating the rate and pattern of A. gayanus spread from future LiDAR campaigns. In addition, this high-resolution mapping can be used to inform satellite image analysis for the evaluation of A. gayanus invasion over broader regional scales. Our research highlights the huge potential that airborne LiDAR holds for facilitating the monitoring and management of savanna habitat condition.},

Sable antelope, Hippotragus niger, populations have declined substantially in Kruger National Park, South Africa despite large-area protection from land use and poaching. Since Africa's large mammal populations are restricted to protected areas, understanding how to manage parks for biological diversity is critically important to the sustainability of faunal populations into the future. To better understand the drivers of sable decline, we analyzed landscapes where herds persist in the Pretoriuskop region of Kruger - identified by GPS collar telemetry data from eight individuals in five herds remaining in this area, and compared them to landscapes where sable herds have recently disappeared. We mapped these landscapes with satellite-based spectral data on vegetation greenness and fire frequency and Carnegie Airborne Observatory LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data on 3-D vegetation structure. Within their home ranges, sable herds consistently selected areas with high fire frequency, high tree cover and low shrub cover. However, there were no consistent differences in habitat features between the home ranges of current sable herds and areas formerly supporting herds. Locally deteriorating habitat conditions were therefore not responsible for the decline in sables in this region of the park. Our study also illustrates how multi-sensor, 3-D mapping of ecosystems provides a means to assess causes and consequences of changing animal habitats over time.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. European beech forest with a variable admixture is one of the most important forest types in Central Europe. Growing evidence has demonstrated the positive effect of increased biodiversity on vital forest ecosystem functions and services such as productivity and nutrient cycling. Both complementarity in resource use and species identity are known to influence tree productivity but they have received relatively little attention in observational studies. Using a large dataset of repeat inventory trees in a near-natural deciduous forest in Central Germany we test whether tree diversity enhances tree productivity at the tree and the stand level, whilst accounting for tree size, tree vitality, local topography and the potentially confounding effects of spatial autocorrelation and negative growth estimates. Beech and hornbeam individual tree growth was sensitive to their neighbourhood diversity and composition whilst ash trees were only sensitive to the neighbourhood tree density. Neighbourhood complementarity effects were driven by differences in species' competitive strengths, whilst at the stand level productivity gains were primarily attributable to the density of ash and diversity effects were less prominent. We conclude that small-scale admixture with patches of different species promotes tree growth in European beech forest; congruent with current management plans for beech and hardwood forests.},

Translocations and reintroductions are key elements for the population management of the critically endangered black rhino (Diceros bicornis, Linnaeus, 1758). In this study, we investigated the postrelease behaviour and habitat preferences of a black rhino starter group (n = 4) on the individual level. The animals were reintroduced to a fenced game reserve (87 km2) in North-Central Namibia 1 year prior to our study. We used camera traps and very high frequency (VHF) radiotelemetry to examine the animals' temporal and spatial behaviour over a period of 4 months at transition between wet and dry seasons. Our results underline a peak in drinking activity and waterhole visits occurring between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. We found a shift in intensity in drinking activity during the period of the study. Satellite-based woody cover estimations only suggest positive correlations between the density of woody cover and favoured black rhino habitat types. Although the area seems suitable to facilitate breeding success of this starter group, it does not support a self-sustaining population. However, black rhinos were already successfully reintroduced to several additional fenced reserves in this region. The selective opening of fences in the future could help to enable genetic exchange between currently isolated groups of rhinos.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 British Ecological Society. Fire is a key determinant of woody vegetation structure in savanna ecosystems, acting both independently and synergistically through interactions with herbivores. Fire influences biodiversity and ecological functioning, but quantifying its effects on woody structure is challenging at both species and community scales. Deeper insight into fire effects, and fire-herbivore interactions, can be gained through the examination of species-specific demographic and dynamic changes occurring across areas with different fire regimes in the presence of large herbivores. We used the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (an integrated LiDAR and imaging spectroscopy system) to map woody tree structure, species and dynamics over a four-year interval across two adjacent savanna landscapes with contrasting fire histories in Kruger National Park, South Africa. A history of higher fire frequency was associated with reduced woody canopy cover (17{\%} vs. 23{\%}) and an increased overall rate of treefall (27{\%} vs. 18{\%}). The landscape with a history of higher fire frequency displayed a shift in woody canopy height distribution from a unimodal curve to a bimodal pattern at the community scale, with large reductions in height classes {\textless}7 m. Differences in tree height distributions and treefall rates across sites were underpinned by species-specific responses to fire frequency. Acacia nigrescens displayed the highest rates of treefall, most likely related to elephant activity, with losses exceeding 40{\%} in the 6- to 9-m height classes. Synthesis. Our findings indicate that fire history imparts demographic legacies not only on vegetation structure, but also on current vegetation dynamics. Current treefall rates of certain tree species are exacerbated by a history of higher fire frequency. Species-specific and context-conscious investigations are critical for elucidating the driving mechanisms underlying broader community patterns.},

Location: The study area extends from 30°N to 80°N, covering three forest biomes - temperate broadleaf and mixed forests (TBMF), temperate conifer forests (TCF) and boreal forests (BFT) - over three continents (North America, Europe and Asia). Methods: This study is based on a recently available growing stock volume (GSV) product retrieved from synthetic aperture radar data. Forest biomass and spatially explicit uncertainty estimates were derived from the GSV using existing databases of wood density and allometric relationships between biomass compartments (stem, branches, roots, foliage). We tested the resultant map against inventory-based biomass data from Russia, Europe and the USA prior to making intercontinent and interbiome carbon stock comparisons. Results: Our derived carbon density map agrees well with inventory data at regional scales (r2=0.70-0.90). While 40.7±15.7 petagram of carbon (PgC) are stored in BFT, TBMF and TCF contain 24.5±9.4PgC and 14.5±4.8 PgC, respectively. In terms of carbon density, we found 6.21±2.07kgC m-2 retained in TCF and 5.80±2.21kgC m-2 in TBMF, whereas BFT have a mean carbon density of 4.00±1.54kgC m-2. Indications of a higher carbon density in Europe compared with the other continents across each of the three biomes could not be proved to be significant. Main conclusions: The presented carbon density and corresponding uncertainty map give an insight into the spatial patterns of biomass and stand as a new benchmark to improve carbon cycle models and carbon monitoring systems.

However, detailed maps of plant community structure at landscape scales seldom exist due to the inability of field-based inventories to map a sufficient number of individuals over large areas. The Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO) collected hyperspectral and lidar data over Kruger National Park, South Africa, and these data were used to remotely identify {\textgreater}500 000 tree and shrub crowns over a 144-km2 landscape using stacked support vector machines. Maps of community compositional variation were produced by ordination and clustering, and the importance of hillslope-scale topo-edaphic variation in shaping community structure was evaluated with redundancy analysis. This remote species identification approach revealed spatially complex patterns in woody plant communities throughout the landscape that could not be directly observed using field-based methods alone. We estimated that topo-edaphic variables representing catenal sequences explained 21{\%} of species compositional variation, while we also uncovered important community patterns that were unrelated to catenas, indicating a large role for other soil-related factors in shaping the savanna community.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 International Association for Vegetation Science. Questions: Termite mounds of the genus Macrotermes are prominent features in African savannas, forming nutrient hotspots that support greater plant diversity, which is of higher nutritional value than the surrounding savanna matrix. However, little is known about grass communities on and around mounds or how the functional importance of mounds varies across sites. As mean annual rainfall increases, savannas in southern Africa become increasingly dystrophic through increased denitrification (including pyrodenitrification) and the leaching of soil nutrients. The functional importance of mounds is concomitantly expected to increase as the difference in foliar nutrient levels between mounds and the savanna matrix increases. We tested this prediction on grass communities across a rainfall gradient to: (i) determine the degree to which grass assemblages differ between termite mounds and the savanna matrix; (ii) determine the spatial extent to which mounds influence grass communities; and (iii) investigate whether these patterns differ across savanna types. Location: Kruger National Park, South Africa. Methods: Grass communities were surveyed at three savanna sites differing in mean annual rainfall (550-750 mm{\textperiodcentered}yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}). Grass diversity and tissue nitrogen concentrations were measured on and off termite mounds and along transects away from mounds in order to calculate the spatial influence of termite mounds on savanna grass communities. Using termite mound densities estimated from airborne LiDAR, we up-scaled field-based results to determine the percentage of the landscape influenced by Macrotermes termite activity. Results: Although species richness of grasses was lower on mounds than in the savanna matrix, the assemblage composition varied significantly, with higher nutrient concentrations in grasses located on mounds. This pattern became more distinct with increasing rainfall. The spatial extent of these nutrient-rich grasses also differed across the rainfall gradient, with a larger sphere of influence around mounds in wetter areas. Mounds distinctly altered grass communities over ca. 2{\%} of the entire landscape. Conclusions: Our results show that Macrotermes mounds are important components of savanna heterogeneity, and reveal that the functional importance of mounds increases with increasing rainfall.},

Using the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO), we mapped the distribution of termite mounds across a rainfall gradient within a river catchment ({\~{}} 27 000 ha) of the Kruger National Park, South Africa. We assessed how different factors were associated with the distribution and height of termite mounds at three spatial scales: the entire catchment, among three broad vegetation types, and on individual hillslope crests. Abiotic factors such as the underlying geology and mean annual precipitation shaped mound densities at broad scales, while local hillslope morphology strongly influenced mound distribution at finer scales, emphasising the importance of spatial scale when assessing mound densities. Fire return period had no apparent association with mound densities or height. Mound density averaged 0.46 mounds ha-1, and exhibited a clustered pattern throughout the landscape, occurring at relatively high densities (up to 2 mounds ha-1) on crests, which are nutrient-poor elements of the landscape. Mounds exhibited significant over-dispersion (even spacing) at scales below 60 m so that evenly spaced aggregations of termite mounds are embedded within a landscape of varying mound densities. The tallest mounds were found in dry savanna (500 mm yr-1) and were positively correlated with mound density, suggesting that dry granitic savannas are ideal habitat for mound-building termites. Mound activity status also varied significantly across the rainfall gradient, with a higher proportion of active (live) mounds in the drier sites. The differential spacing of mounds across landscapes provides essential nutrient hotspots in crest locations, potentially sustaining species that would otherwise not persist. The contribution to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning that mounds provide is not uniform throughout landscapes, but varies considerably with spatial scale and context. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

Here, we measure geochemical and geomorphic properties of catchments in Kruger National Park, South Africa, where granitic lithology and erosion rates are invariant, enabling us to evaluate how varying mean annual precipitation(MAP = 470 mm, 550 mm, and 730 mm) impacts hill-valley spacing or landscape dissection. Catchment-averaged erosion rates, based on 10Be concentrations in river sands, are low (3-6 m/m.y.) and vary minimally across the three sites. Our lidar-derived slope-area analyses reveal that hillslopes in the dry site are gentle (3{\%}) and short, such that the terrain is low relief and appears highly dissected. With increasing rainfall, hillslopes lengthen and increase in gradient (6{\%}-8{\%}), resulting in less-dissected, higher-relief catchments. The chemical depletion fraction of hilltop regoliths increases with rainfall, from 0.3 to 0.7, reflecting a climate-driven increase in chemical relative to physical erosion. Soil catenas also vary systematically with climate as we observe relatively uniform soil properties in the dry site that contrast with leached sandy crests and upper slopes coupled with downslope clay accumulation zones in the intermediate and wet sites. The geomorphic texture of this slow-eroding, granitic landscape appears to be set by climate-driven feedbacks among chemical weathering, regolith fabric differentiation, hydrological routing, and sediment transport that enhance the vigor of hillslope sediment transport relative to valley-forming processes for wetter climates. {\textcopyright} 2013 Geological Society of America.},

Tree height was unchanged in 77{\%} of monitored trees, but 5{\%} increased and 18{\%} decreased in height by 1m or more. We identified 12,703 trees (10.6{\%}) that were completely toppled during the study period.

Spatial patterns of treefall were significantly clustered across the landscapes, with proportional rates of loss exceeding 30{\%} in some hillslope patches. These high rates of tree loss present a challenge to biodiversity conservation and management, as tall tree populations may struggle to persist if these rates are maintained over longer time scales.

abstract = {The distribution of woody biomass in savannas reflects spatial patterns fundamental to ecosystem processes, such as water flow, competition, and herbivory, and is a key contributor to savanna ecosystem services, such as fuelwood supply. While total precipitation sets an upper bound on savanna woody biomass, the extent to which substrate and terrain constrain trees and shrubs below this maximum remains poorly understood, often occluded by local-scale disturbances such as fire and trampling. Here we investigate the role of hillslope topography and soil properties in controlling woody plant aboveground biomass (AGB) in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Large-area sampling with airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) provided a means to average across local-scale disturbances, revealing an unexpectedly linear relationship between AGB and hillslope-position on basalts, where biomass levels were lowest on crests, and linearly increased toward streams (R2 = 0.91). The observed pattern was different on granite substrates, where AGB exhibited a strongly non-linear relationship with hillslope position: AGB was high on crests, decreased midslope, and then increased near stream channels (R 2 = 0.87). Overall, we observed 5-to-8-fold lower AGB on clayey, basalt-derived soil than on granites, and we suggest this is due to herbivore-fire interactions rather than lower hydraulic conductivity or clay shrinkage/swelling, as previously hypothesized. By mapping AGB within and outside fire and herbivore exclosures, we found that basalt-derived soils support tenfold higher AGB in the absence of fire and herbivory, suggesting high clay content alone is not a proximal limitation on AGB. Understanding how fire and herbivory contribute to AGB heterogeneity is critical to predicting future savanna carbon storage under a changing climate. {\textcopyright} 2012 Author(s).},

abstract = {Spatial variability in the effects of fire on savanna vegetation structure is seldom considered in ecology, despite the inherent heterogeneity of savanna landscapes. Much has been learned about the effects of fire on vegetation structure from long-term field experiments, but these are often of limited spatial extent and do not encompass different hillslope catena elements. We mapped vegetation three-dimensional (3-D) structure over 21 000 ha in nine savanna landscapes (six on granite, three on basalt), each with contrasting long-term fire histories (higher and lower fire frequency), as defined from a combination of satellite imagery and 67 years of management records. Higher fire frequency areas contained less woody canopy cover than their lower fire frequency counterparts in all landscapes, and woody cover reduction increased linearly with increasing difference in fire frequency (r2=0.58, P=0.004). Vegetation height displayed a more heterogeneous response to difference in fire frequency, with taller canopies present in the higher fire frequency areas of the wetter sites. Vegetation 3-Dstructural differences between areas of higher and lower fire frequency differed between geological substrates and varied spatially across hillslopes. Fire had the greatest relative impact on vegetation structure on nutrient-rich basalt substrates, and it imparted different structural responses upon vegetation in upland, midslope, and lowland topographic positions. These results highlight the complexity of fire- vegetation relationships in savanna systems, and they suggest that underlying landscape heterogeneity needs more explicit incorporation into fire management policies. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

We combined landscape-scale herbivore exclosures with repeat airborne Light Detection and Ranging of 58 429 trees in Kruger National Park, South Africa, to assess sources of savanna treefall across nested gradients of climate, topography, and soil fertility. Elephants were revealed as the primary agent of treefall across widely varying savanna conditions, and a large-scale 'elephant trap' predominantly removes maturing savanna trees in the 5-9 m height range. Treefall rates averaged 6 times higher in areas accessible to elephants, but proportionally more treefall occurred on high-nutrient basalts and in lowland catena areas. These patterns were superimposed on a climate-mediated regime of increasing treefall with precipitation in the absence of herbivores. These landscape-scale patterns reveal environmental controls underpinning herbivore-mediated tree turnover, highlighting the need for context-dependent science and management. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of ecological systems is fundamental to their successful management and conservation. Much research and debate has focused on identifying underlying drivers of vegetation change in savannas, yet few have considered the influence of spatial context and heterogeneity. Our goal was to develop deeper understanding of woody vegetation spatio-temporal dynamics through spatially explicit utilization of historical aerial photography and airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging). We first assessed temporal change in woody vegetation cover through object-based image analysis of an aerial photography record that spanned 59 years from 1942 to 2001. Secondly, we tested the spatial relationships between environmental variables and patterns of woody structure and dynamics at broad (100 ha), medium (10 ha) and fine-scales (1 ha) through canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Finally, we used LiDAR derived vegetation heights to explore current woody vegetation structure in the context of historical patterns of change. Total percentage woody cover was stable over time, but woody dynamics were highly variable at smaller scales and displayed distinct spatial trends across the landscape. Losses of woody cover on the diverse alluvial substrates were countered by increases of cover on the hillslopes. Analysis of current woody structure in the context of historical change revealed that the increases took place in the form of shrub encroachment and not the replacement of tall trees. We infer that mammalian herbivory contributed substantially to the losses on lowland alluvial soils, whilst shrub encroachment on the upland hillslopes likely stemmed from changes in fire regime and climate. Deeper reflection on spatial variability is needed in the debate around drivers of change in savanna systems, as spatial patterns of change revealed that different drivers underlie vegetation dynamics in different landscape contexts. Spatial heterogeneity needs explicit consideration in the exploration of pattern-process relationships in ecological systems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Global vegetation models predict the spread of woody vegetation in African savannas and grasslands under future climate scenarios, but they operate too broadly to consider hillslope-scale variations in tree - grass distribution. Topographically linked hydrology - soil - vegetation sequences, or catenas, underpin a variety of ecological processes in savannas, including responses to climate change. In this study, we explore the three-dimensional structure of hillslopes and vegetation, using high-resolution airborne LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging), to understand the long-term effects of mean annual precipitation (MAP) on catena pattern. Our results reveal that the presence and position of hillslope hydrological boundaries, or seeplines, vary as a function of MAP through its long-term influence on clay redistribution. We suggest that changes in climate will differentially alter the structure of savannas through hydrological changes to the seasonally saturated grasslands downslope of seeplines. The mechanisms underlying future woody encroachment are not simply physiological responses to elevated temperatures and CO2 levels but also involve hydrogeomorphological processes at the hillslope scale. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Object-based image analysis (OBIA) is gaining rapid popularity in remote sensing science as a means of bridging very high spatial resolution (VHSR) imagery and GIS. Multiscalar image segmentation is a fundamental step in OBIA, yet there is currently no tool available to objectively guide the selection of appropriate scales for segmentation. We present a technique for estimating the scale parameter in image segmentation of remotely sensed data with Definiens Developer{\textregistered}. The degree of heterogeneity within an image-object is controlled by a subjective measure called the 'scale parameter', as implemented in the mentioned software. We propose a tool, called estimation of scale parameter (ESP), that builds on the idea of local variance (LV) of object heterogeneity within a scene. The ESP tool iteratively generates image-objects at multiple scale levels in a bottom-up approach and calculates the LV for each scale. Variation in heterogeneity is explored by evaluating LV plotted against the corresponding scale. The thresholds in rates of change of LV (ROC-LV) indicate the scale levels at which the image can be segmented in the most appropriate manner, relative to the data properties at the scene level. Our tests on different types of imagery indicated fast processing times and accurate results. The simple yet robust ESP tool enables fast and objective parametrization when performing image segmentation and holds great potential for OBIA applications. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

We mapped terrain, termite mound and woody vegetation three-dimensional (3-D) structure at 56cm resolution across a large-scale (254ha), long-term (34 years) herbivore exclusion experiment in the Kruger National Park, with the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO). We compared vegetation 3-D structure in areas protected from herbivores with those accessible to herbivores, both on termite mounds and in the landscape matrix between termite mounds. Termite mound density was 1.1ha-1 across the study area and mound size did not differ between protected and accessible areas. Woody vegetation canopy cover was ∼100{\%} greater on protected than accessible mounds, but was only ∼20{\%} greater in the protected inter-mound matrix when compared to the accessible matrix. Woody canopy height class distributions differed significantly between protected and accessible areas, with the tallest vegetation ({\textgreater}10m) occurring on protected termite mounds. The impacts of herbivore browsing were evident at distances of up to 20m from termite mound centres. Spatial analysis of mound distribution revealed that the sphere of termite mound influence constitutes ∼20{\%} of the total landscape. Termite influences on herbivore browsing operate at scales much larger than the spatial extent of their mound building activities. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Savanna ecosystems are comprised of complex three-dimensional (3-D) mixtures of woody and herbaceous vegetation, along with varying amounts of bare soil, rock, and other background features. Understanding, monitoring, and managing the spatiotemporal variation in Savanna ecological processes requires a quantitative understanding of the 3-D structure and biochemical properties of the vegetation. Remote sensing provides a uniquely powerful approach to quantify vegetation properties in Savannas. Given the enormous geographic extent of both temperate and tropical Savannas (e.g., Huntley and Walker, 1982), combined with their heterogeneity at local scales, the need for remote sensing seems obvious. As a result, there has been continuing effort to develop and apply both airborne and satellite mapping approaches to estimate key aspects of Savanna structure and biochemistry.},

Ensuring the sustainability of Africa's natural protected areas requires information on the efficacy of management decisions at large spatial scales, but often neither experimental treatments nor large-scale responses are available for analysis. Using a new airborne remote sensing system, we mapped the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of vegetation at a spatial resolution of 56 cm throughout 1640 ha of savanna after 6-, 22-, 35-, and 41-year exclusions of herbivores, as well as in unprotected areas, across Kruger National Park in South Africa. Areas in which herbivores were excluded over the short term (6 years) contained 38{\%}–80{\%} less bare ground compared with those that were exposed to mammalian herbivory. In the longer-term ({\textgreater} 22 years), the 3-D structure of woody vegetation differed significantly between protected and accessible landscapes, with up to 11-fold greater woody canopy cover in the areas without herbivores. Our maps revealed 2 scales of ecosystem response to herbivore consumption, one broadly mediated by geologic substrate and the other mediated by hillslope-scale variation in soil nutrient availability and moisture conditions. Our results are the first to quantitatively illustrate the extent to which herbivores can affect the 3-D structural diversity of vegetation across large savanna landscapes.},

abstract = {Landscapes commonly comprise of mosaics, patches and boundaries. Riparian boundaries are complex to delineate and characterize, with a multitude of variables available for delineation. Multiple methods exist for boundary delineation such as two-dimensional wombling, constrained classification techniques and discontinuity detection. One method that has proven to be reliable in boundary delineation with one-dimensional transect data is the moving split window (MSW) analysis. This study demonstrates the efficacy of MSW to delineate grass species turnover and environmental boundaries across two geologically dissimilar riparian zones in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. There are few studies that have delineated riparian boundaries of Kruger National Park, and none that have used the MSW analysis. MSW detects significant changes in dissimilarity indices of variables along gradients. Significant shifts in dissimilarity designate boundaries at various spatial scales dictated by window sizes. Significant boundaries emerge by altering window sizes, increasing quadrat width and removing infrequent herbaceous species. By utilizing these three methods, MSW background variance was reduced and riparian and wetland/upland boundaries were sharper and more easily defined. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Fire regime and herbivore numbers are two key variables that managers of protected areas can manipulate to meet their conservation objectives. We deployed a new airborne remote sensing system (Carnegie Airborne Observatory) to the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, to map a unique herbivore/fire exclusion experiment on basaltic soils. We collected high resolution (56 cm) three-dimensional (3-D) vegetation structural data over areas that have been protected from herbivores (34 yr) and/or fire (7 yr), as well as those exposed to both disturbance agents. Canopy height distribution, as well as the distribution of foliage within the vertical canopy profile, differed significantly between all treatments and between each treatment and the control area (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, p {\textless} 0.001). Herbivory exerted a greater influence on vegetation 3-D structure and heterogeneity than did fire. At the broad scale, total percentage woody cover was 36 times greater in areas protected from herbivores, compared to the control area. At a finer scale, areas protected from herbivores contained 5 times more tall tree canopy ({\textgreater}9 m) and up to 66 times more small tree canopy (3-6 m). Fire restricted growth of vegetation in the 0-3 m height range, both in the absence and presence of herbivores. Our findings highlight the active role that conservation managers can play in modifying vegetation structure and heterogeneity through herbivore and fire management, as well as the value of 3-D remote sensing for the assessment of conservation management outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Growing recognition of the importance of the structural component of biodiversity has highlighted the need to understand the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of woody plant structural diversity. Advances in LiDAR technology have enabled three dimensional information of vegetation to be obtained remotely over large areas. Whilst the use of LiDAR has gained considerable momentum in forested areas there has been limited application to savanna systems. We explore the applicability of LiDAR and object-based image analysis to the monitoring of woody structural diversity in a savanna system. We demonstrate how an object-based approach to image analysis significantly improves the accuracy of woody layer classification form in a heterogeneous landscape. Furthermore we illustrate how standard approaches to LiDAR derived canopy models suffer from interpolation artifacts in savannas, due to the heterogeneity of the woody layer. By integrating LiDAR with high resolution aerial photography, through object-based analysis, these artifacts can be removed to produce a robust canopy model. The object-based integration of LiDAR with aerial imagery holds immense potential for structural diversity monitoring in savannas.},

abstract = {The impact of browsers on the structure of woody vegetation has been well documented in savanna landscapes but the spatial distribution of these impacts is poorly understood. Savannas are structurally heterogeneous and the effects of browsers are unlikely to be evenly distributed across them. A mammalian exclosure in northern Kruger Park, South Africa, was used to explore the impacts of 15 years of browser exclusion on woody vegetation across a wetland/upland boundary. Woody patches inside the exclosure were taller than those outside of the exclosure and differential patch and species specific responses were observed within and without the exclosure. A boundary between upland and wetland patch types showed the greatest response to browser exclusion in terms of woody species composition, height and stem diameter. Browser impacts are not distributed evenly across the landscape, but are focused on certain patch and species types. Browsers have the potential to markedly alter system heterogeneity. Landscape heterogeneity is an integral component of biodiversity, but is often not explicitly dealt with in protected area management. Typically monitoring of vegetation change in conservation areas occurs at broad scales and would not detect the change in either the patch type or species specific responses identified in this study. We recommend that protected area managers adopt a multi-scaled, spatially explicit approach to monitoring change in the landscape.
