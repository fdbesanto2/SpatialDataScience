Welcome! The GEARS Lab is led by Associate Professor Shaun Levick and is based at Charles Darwin University and the CSIRO in Darwin, Australia. Our research lab uses remote sensing and spatial data analytics to improve land management outcomes in tropical landscapes. Research interests include fire ecology, natural capital accounting, functional landscape rehabilitation, and computer vision for science communication.
