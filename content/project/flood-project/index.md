The main aim of this NESP funded project is to explore floodplain inundation patterns and improve understanding of ecological flow requirements in the Daly River catchment. Time-series of Landsat-5/7/8 and Sentinel-1/2 satellite images are being integrated to track inundation patterns through time and space.
